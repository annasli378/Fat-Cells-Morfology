# Adiopocyte analysis

Adipocytes are adipose tissue cells and are the body's main energy store. Their main role is to store energy in the form of triglycerides. In a situation of higher energy demand, the body can derive the substrates it needs from the stored reserves through the process of lipolysis, i.e. breakdown. On the other hand, when the food supply is too high and the amount of energy expended by the body is lower, lipogenesis will occur and the excess will be deposited in the fat cells.  

## Data 
Input: H&E 40x digital images in .tif format.

## Aim 

1. Analysis of fat cells morphology (area, shape and distance from other cells) in the bedding of the small intestine. 
2. To see if correlations can be found between these characteristics and variables such as gender or the need for reccurent surgery.
